/** Standard data structures and data models used throughout the project.
  *
  * All of the classes in this package are pure case classes. Some have methods and functions for
  * JSON de/serialization. All are completely immutable, and fully thread-safe. If there is a
  * known finite number of the thing the class is supposed to model,
  * the companion object provides immutable instances. The constructor is left public just in
  * case, but in general the static instances should be used. This package is completely free
  * from Android imports.
