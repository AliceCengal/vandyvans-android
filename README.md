Vandy Vans
==========

Vandy Vans is an open-source Android project created by [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu) students 
through the student organization [VandyApps](https://www.facebook.com/VandyMobile).

The purpose of the app is to provide a fast, native way for Vanderbilt students to access the van schedule as well 
as a live map of the vans' locations on their Android phones.
